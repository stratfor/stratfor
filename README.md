I write code. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it sends signals into deep space. Either way, it's **not** a bugâ€”it's an undocumented feature.  

Expect a mix of cool projects, questionable experiments, and the occasional moment of brilliance (or disaster).  
Some call it "innovation," others call it "why is this smoking?" ðŸ”¥  

If you come across a project that seems to exist in a legal gray areaâ€”one where the line between *cool tech* and *government property* is a bit blurryâ€”just remember:  
**I was never here, and you saw nothing.** ðŸ‘€  

If it works, I take full credit. If it breaks, it was working when I last checked.  

**Proceed with caution. Or donâ€™t. Iâ€™m not your supervisor.**
